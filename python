# 1. User Profile Creation
#    - Collect user measurements (height, weight, body shape, etc.)
#    - Use profile pictures to estimate body proportions
#    - Store this data in a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL)

# 2. Color Analysis
#    - Extract skin tone information from profile pictures
#    - Use color theory to determine flattering colors
#    - Map skin tone to color palettes (warm, cool, neutral)

# 3. Outfit Recommendation System
#    - Train an AI model (e.g., neural network) on outfit data
#    - Features: user measurements, occasion, weather, personal style
#    - Output: recommended outfits (tops, bottoms, accessories)
#    - Consider fashion rules (e.g., complementary colors)

# 4. Virtual Try-On
#    - Create a 3D avatar using user measurements
#    - Render outfits on the avatar
#    - WebGL or similar for real-time visualization

# 5. Integration with Stores
#    - Barcode/QR code scanning for clothes
#    - Show items on the user's avatar
#    - Collaborate with stores for mirror integration

# 6. Occasion-Based Suggestions
#    - Based on the user's calendar or input, recommend outfits
#    - Casual, formal, business, party, etc.

# 7. User Interface (Frontend)
#    - Web or mobile app
#    - Display recommended outfits
#    - Allow users to try different combinations

# 8. Testing and User Feedback
#    - Continuously improve the AI model
#    - Gather feedback from users

# Remember to handle exceptions, privacy concerns, and edge cases!

# Pseudocode for outfit recommendation:
def recommend_outfit(user_profile, occasion):
    # Load pre-trained outfit recommendation model
    model = load_model()

    # Input features (user measurements, occasion, etc.)
    features = preprocess_features(user_profile, occasion)

    # Get outfit recommendations
    recommended_outfits = model.predict(features)

    return recommended_outfits

# Example usage:
user_profile = {
    'height': 170,
    'weight': 65,
    'skin_tone': 'warm',
    # Other measurements...
}

occasion = 'casual'
outfits = recommend_outfit(user_profile, occasion)
print("Recommended outfits for", occasion, ":", outfits)
